Ever alert for treachery and danger, he speaks little but is apt to be polite (if terse) in his dealings. A perfectionist who yearns to be accepted into places and groups and to make friends widely, Drizzt is haunted by the danger he brings to those he befriends thanks to the scrutiny of Lolth and his other foes (notably the demon Errtu and the human Artemis Entreri).

He fled to the north to avoid capture after stealing his former master's magical ruby pendant. Eventually, he found companionship amongst the Companions of the Hall, becoming one of Bruenor Battlehammer's most trusted confidants. Bruenor was the one who gifted Regis with the nickname 'Rumblebelly' due to the halfling's insatiable appetite. Regis would prefer nothing more than to relax in the sun with a full belly near his home in Ten-Towns and fish for knucklehead trout, the source of all of his scrimshaw carvings. But when his friends need help, Regis is always there for them. He never sees himself as the hero, even though his true friends know better.",

One night an army of drow and their minions descended upon the village in force. Galor saved Zorbu's life, but many others were killed, including Zorbu's parents. From that day forth, Zorbu trained under Galor as a ranger, vowing revenge upon the drow and any who claim allegiance to them.

Very little is known of Strix's heritage, even to herself, but it was recently discovered that she was a powerful member of the Skizziks family, who long ago made a pact with Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, to become Tieflings. Strix is careful, suspicious, and paranoid. She assumes the worst in everyone and is always ready to run away or hide. She lacks basic manners and maintains poor personal hygiene, exemplified by the collection of filthy oddities she hoards within her robes. As a child, Strix witnessed a shadowy creature slaughter her friends at the bakery where she worked, but was spared for unknown reasons. Her survivor's guilt drives her to try and help those in need, no matter the personal cost.",

            "backstory": "A young Eladrin woman, raised to be the Queen of Koshmarr, what was meant to be an idyllic life took a dark turn on the night of her wedding. Pulled into the machinations of greater powers, she found herself in Mordent, now one of the many wandering ghosts. A person of great interest both to Azalin Rex and Strahd, she sought to negotiate her freedom from these dread domains. Her longtime companions and their newfound friends wanted the same and imbued her soul into Desmond's sword. As they traveled in search of returning her soul to her body, Voronika took matters into her own hands and used the crown of the Raven Queen to defeat Zybilna and cause the fall of Prismeer. This action drew the mists to Voronika and soon she discovered herself a new darklord in her domain of Koshmarr.",

He put his talents to work on the sea, traveling with crews who he hoped would ask nothing more than that he earn his keep by way of his Storm sorcery. One day, tired of wandering, he ended up in the quiet lakeside town of Caradoon, thinking he might put down roots. But that all changed when he met and fell for a kindred spirit in the form of a charming and witty tiefling named Kent. After some over-enthusiastic handling of the local tavern's rat problem, they found themselves on the move again, met up with Selise Astorio of the Rivals of Waterdeep, becoming quickly entangled in the group's adventures, and realizing that they had found a new family and a new home.",
