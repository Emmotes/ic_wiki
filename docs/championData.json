One night an army of Lolth's followers descended upon the village in force. Galor saved Zorbu's life, but many others were killed, including Zorbu's parents. From that day forth, Zorbu trained under Galor as a ranger, vowing to prevent another such tragedy from occurring.

Strix is careful, suspicious, and paranoid. She assumes the worst in everyone and is always ready to run away or hide. She lacks basic manners and maintains poor personal hygiene, exemplified by the collection of filthy oddities she hoards within her robes. As a child, Strix witnessed a shadowy creature slaughter her friends at the bakery where she worked, but was spared for unknown reasons.

One day, tired of wandering, he ended up in the quiet lakeside town of Caradoon, thinking he might put down roots. But that all changed when he met and fell for a kindred spirit in the form of a charming and witty tiefling named Kent. After some over-enthusiastic handling of the local tavern's rat problem, they found themselves on the move again, met up with Selise Astorio of the Rivals of Waterdeep, becoming quickly entangled in the group's adventures, and realizing that they had found a new family and a new home.","classes":"Sorcerer","event":true,"fName":"virgil","gender":"Male","id":115,"name":"Virgil","nameFull":"Virgil Zoar","nameShort":"Virgil","species":"Aasimar","retired":false,"roles":"Support / Speed","seat":10,"patrons":["Mirt","Vajra","Strahd","Zariel (with Feat)","Elminster"],"spoiler":false,"stats":[9,13,14,13,12,18],"statsFeats":[10,13,14,13,12,18],"totalStats":79,"totalStatsFeats":80,"year":6,"portrait":true,"console":true,"formation":true,"attacks":{"base":[{"id":566,"name":"Magic Missile","description":"Virgil fires 3 magic missiles at random targets.","long_description":"","graphic_id":0,"target":"random","num_targets":3,"aoe_radius":0,"damage_modifier":1,"cooldown":8,"animations":[{"type":"ranged_attack","projectile":"magic_missile","projectile_details":{"projectile_graphic_id":16680,"impact_graphic_id":16681,"impact_scale_x":2,"impact_scale_y":2,"impact_offset_y":-45,"trail_tint":"#BEBEFF","projectile_graphic_tint":"#BEBEFF","impact_tint":"#BEBEFF","graphic_source":"virgil"},"shoot_frame":9,"projectile_delay":0.1,"projectile_count":3,"shoot_sound":149,"hit_sound":133,"shoot_offset_x":40,"shoot_offset_y":-25}],"tags":["ranged","multitarget"],"damage_types":["magic"]},{"id":567,"name":"Magic Missile","description":"Virgil fires 3 magic missiles at random targets.","long_description":"","graphic_id":0,"target":"random","num_targets":3,"aoe_radius":0,"damage_modifier":1,"cooldown":8,"animations":[{"type":"ranged_attack","projectile":"magic_missile","projectile_details":{"projectile_graphic_id":16680,"impact_graphic_id":16681,"impact_scale_x":2,"impact_scale_y":2,"impact_offset_y":-50,"trail_tint":"#00FF00","projectile_graphic_tint":"#00FF00","impact_tint":"#00FF00","graphic_source":"virgil"},"shoot_frame":9,"projectile_delay":0.1,"projectile_count":3,"shoot_sound":149,"hit_sound":133,"shoot_offset_x":40,"shoot_offset_y":-25}],"tags":["ranged","multitarget"],"damage_types":["magic"]},{"id":568,"name":"Magic Missile","description":"Virgil fires 4 magic missiles at random targets with a chance to stun.","long_description":"","graphic_id":0,"target":"random","num_targets":4,"aoe_radius":0,"damage_modifier":1,"cooldown":8,"animations":[{"type":"ranged_attack","projectile":"magic_missile","projectile_details":{"projectile_graphic_id":16680,"impact_graphic_id":16681,"impact_scale_x":2,"impact_scale_y":2,"impact_offset_y":-45,"trail_tint":"#FFCC00","projectile_graphic_tint":"#FFCC00","impact_tint":"#FFCC00","graphic_source":"virgil"},"effects_on_monsters":[{"effect_string":"monster_stun,5,1509","apply_chance":0.25}],"shoot_frame":9,"projectile_delay":0.1,"projectile_count":4,"shoot_sound":149,"hit_sound":133,"shoot_offset_x":40,"shoot_offset_y":-25}],"tags":["ranged","multitarget"],"damage_types":["magic"]},{"id":569,"name":"Magic Missile","description":"Virgil fires 3 magic missiles at random targets.","long_description":"","graphic_id":0,"target":"random","num_targets":3,"aoe_radius":0,"damage_modifier":1,"cooldown":8,"animations":[{"type":"ranged_attack","projectile":"magic_missile","projectile_details":{"projectile_graphic_id":16680,"impact_graphic_id":16681,"impact_scale_x":2,"impact_scale_y":2,"impact_offset_y":-45,"trail_tint":"#EE87FF","projectile_graphic_tint":"#EE87FF","impact_tint":"#EE87FF","graphic_source":"virgil"},"shoot_frame":9,"projectile_delay":0.1,"projectile_count":3,"shoot_sound":149,"hit_sound":133,"shoot_offset_x":40,"shoot_offset_y":-25}],"tags":["ranged","multitarget"],"damage_types":["magic"]}],"ult":[{"id":572,"name":"Chain Lightning","description":"Virgil attacks a random enemy with lightning, chaining up to 20 times.

Its edifice was destroyed in the carnage of the Blood War, but Windfall rebuilt the casino and rededicated it to the Dragon Queen as a celebration of her god's greed and vanity. Windfall is ostentatious and charismatic, making small talk with regular patrons and jovially welcoming new faces to the casino. She once plotted to assemble the Rod of Seven Parts to create a gift for her cruel goddess, but has instead joined the Champions at Tiamat's
