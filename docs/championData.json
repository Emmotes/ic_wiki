Thoughtful and sensitive to others, Drizzt holds himself to the highest ideals but does not expect the same of others. Ever alert for treachery and danger, he speaks little but is apt to be polite (if terse) in his dealings. A perfectionist who yearns to be accepted into places and groups and to make friends widely, Drizzt is haunted by the danger he brings to those he befriends thanks to the scrutiny of Lolth and his other foes (notably the demon Errtu and the human Artemis Entreri). Those he meets see his manner as grim.",

Eventually, he found companionship amongst the Companions of the Hall, becoming one of Bruenor Battlehammer's most trusted confidants. Bruenor was the one who gifted Regis with the nickname 'Rumblebelly' due to the halfling's insatiable appetite. Regis would prefer nothing more than to relax in the sun with a full belly near his home in Ten-Towns and fish for knucklehead trout, the source of all of his scrimshaw carvings. But when his friends need help, Regis is always there for them. He never sees himself as the hero, even though his true friends know better.",

One night an army of drow and their minions descended upon the village in force. Galor saved Zorbu's life, but many others were killed, including Zorbu's parents. From that day forth, Zorbu trained under Galor as a ranger, vowing revenge upon the drow and any who claim allegiance to them. Cunning and imaginative, Zorbu makes use of his tinkering skills to wield an impossibly large crossbow called Thunderbolt.",

Strix is careful, suspicious, and paranoid. She assumes the worst in everyone and is always ready to run away or hide. She lacks basic manners and maintains poor personal hygiene, exemplified by the collection of filthy oddities she hoards within her robes. As a child, Strix witnessed a shadowy creature slaughter her friends at the bakery where she worked, but was spared for unknown reasons. Her survivor's guilt drives her to try and help those in need, no matter the personal cost.",

He was bested in the assault on Ten-Towns by Bruenor who decided his punishment would be five years and a day of service. Bruenor grew to love the tall barbarian, eventually seeing him as an adopted son. At the end of his service, Drizzt Do'Urden taught Wulfgar the ways of combat and Bruenor crafted a mighty warhammer, named Aegis-fang. This magical warhammer bears the symbols of three of the Dwarven Gods: Moradin, Clangeddin, and Dumathoin. It is specifically attuned to Wulfgar and magically returns to his hand upon telepathic command.",

Inside him is an envious amount of courage and a stable sense of logic when things get dire, which has led other party members to consider him their leader. He doesn't agree with the idea, but he's not ready to let his friends down.",

Now, with her ceremonial axe, and memories of Solwynn guiding her, Sentry devotes herself to protecting the friends fighting alongside her. Despite being thrust into a new world eons beyond the one she knew, Sentry defends the good of the world from the dark reaches of evil's grasp. She will not fail again.",

Very few saurials dwell in the Forgotten Realms, and no saurial communities are believed to exist anywhere in the world. The saurial's language is a combination of clicks and whistles beyond the human range of hearing, so Dragonbait relies on 'shouting' scents to communicate emotions. Dragonbait's known scents include: brimstone (confusion), roses (sadness), lemon (pleasure or joy), baked bread (anger), violets (danger or fear), honeysuckle (tenderness or concern), wood smoke (devotion or piety), tar (victory or celebration), and ham (nervousness or worry).",

When she\u2019s not doing murders, Prudence enjoys a good book. Well, not a good book. An evil book. She has two in particular with her at all times in the monstrous forms of her beloved bitey book babies, Frisky and The Darkness. Prudence delights in anything creepy, gory and/or openly evil but has a soft spot for her fellow Oxventurers, who are the only folks this former hermit has any patience for. Either that or she hasn\u2019t found space in her busy murdering schedule to murder them yet.",

Corazón is on a long-term quest to save the former crew of his ship, The Joyful Damnation, from a curse that he is at least partially responsible for. In the short term, the Joyful Damnation has become the Oxventurers\u2019 preferred mode of transportation. Corazón likes to avoid getting his hands dirty, preferring to use fast talking, deception and sheer force of personality to get around trouble. If things come down to a fight, he likes to stay stealthy, hiding, or darting in to take on foes one on one like a true swashbuckler.  And if that fails he can always fall back on the old classic, Grease, the world\u2019s best spell. According to him, And only him.",

When Yorven came across the Witchlight Carnival he managed to convince the owners to bring him on board.

Pulled into the machinations of greater powers, she found herself in Mordent, now one of the many wandering ghosts. A person of great interest both to Azalin Rex and Strahd, she sought to negotiate her freedom from these dread domains. Her longtime companions and their newfound friends wanted the same and imbued her soul into Desmond's sword. As they traveled in search of returning her soul to her body, Voronika took matters into her own hands and used the crown of the Raven Queen to defeat Zybilna and cause the fall of Prismeer. This action drew the mists to Voronika and soon she discovered herself a new darklord in her domain of Koshmarr.",

When he fell ill, she attempted various, wild cures leaving Dob with a permanent, lurid green hue to his skin. Dob became a traveling bard, self-taught in music and magic. This brought him into contact with the Oxventurers, with whom he shares many bizarre adventures. Accomplished and charismatic, this bard favours lulling enemies to sleep or hard-rocking spell attacks with acrobatic combat. Dob also carries Ethelfrith's Hammer, a cursed weapon with the power to summon 60 obedient skeletons, but exacts a heavy price for doing so.",

He put his talents to work on the sea, traveling with crews who he hoped would ask nothing more than that he earn his keep by way of his Storm sorcery. One day, tired of wandering, he ended up in the quiet lakeside town of Caradoon, thinking he might put down roots. But that all changed when he met and fell for a kindred spirit in the form of a charming and witty tiefling named Kent. After some over-enthusiastic handling of the local tavern's rat problem, they found themselves on the move again, met up with Selise Astorio of the Rivals of Waterdeep, becoming quickly entangled in the group's adventures, and realizing that they had found a new family and a new home.",
