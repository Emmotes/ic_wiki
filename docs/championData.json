He fled to the north to avoid capture after stealing his former master's magical ruby pendant. Eventually, he found companionship amongst the Companions of the Hall, becoming one of Bruenor Battlehammer's most trusted confidants. Bruenor was the one who gifted Regis with the nickname 'Rumblebelly' due to the halfling's insatiable appetite. Regis would prefer nothing more than to relax in the sun with a full belly near his home in Ten-Towns and fish for knucklehead trout, the source of all of his scrimshaw carvings. But when his friends need help, Regis is always there for them. He never sees himself as the hero, even though his true friends know better.",

From that day forth, Zorbu trained under Galor as a ranger, vowing revenge upon the drow and any who claim allegiance to them.

Strix is careful, suspicious, and paranoid. She assumes the worst in everyone and is always ready to run away or hide. She lacks basic manners and maintains poor personal hygiene, exemplified by the collection of filthy oddities she hoards within her robes. As a child, Strix witnessed a shadowy creature slaughter her friends at the bakery where she worked, but was spared for unknown reasons.
